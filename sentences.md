# Sentences



According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a sentence is “A [group](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/group) of words, usually [containing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/contain) a [verb](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/verb), that [expresses](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/express) a [thought](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/thought) in the [form](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/form) of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and [starts](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/start) with a [capital](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/capital) [letter](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/letter) when written.”

We can say that a sentence is a word or a group of words that express a complete thought. There are four types of sentences:

- **Declarative** (statement): Tells us something, gives some information.

  -I like chocolate.
  -I don’t like chocolate.

- **Imperative** (command): Tells us to do something. It normally does not have a subject, because it is understood, the subject is you.

  -Eat.
  -Don’t eat!

- **Interrogative** (question): Asks us something, wants some information.
  -Don’t you like chocolate?
  -Where is your house?

- **Exclamative** (exclamation): Expresses emotion or surprise.

  -What a surprise!
  -How nice!

## Combining Sentences

Both independent and dependent clauses are groups of words that contain a subject and a verb. The difference is that an independent clause expresses a complete thought and a dependent clause does not. So, an independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

There are four different sentence structures: simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex.

1. **Simple:** one independent clause.

- Lisa is my neighbor.

1. **Compound:** two or more independent clauses.

- Lisa is my neighbor, and she is my friend.

1. **Complex:** one independent clause, one or more dependent clauses.

- I am her friend because she is adorable.

1. **Compound-complex:** two or more independent clauses, one or more dependent clauses.

- I am her friend because she is adorable, so we are always together.

We are going to work with the two first ones: SIMPLE and COMPOUND. We can combine two independent clauses using a period, a semicolon, or coordinating conjunctions. It is necessary to do it so you can avoid run-on sentences.

- **Period:** We have a new student. He is from Italy.
- **Semicolon:** We have a new student; he is from Italy.
- **Coordinating conjunction:** We have a new student, **and** he is from Italy.

A coordinating conjunction is a word that joins two elements: two verbs, two adjectives, two phrases, two independent clauses, and so on. They are used to make the ideas sound more fluent.

When using them to join two independent clauses, use a comma before the conjunction. It is easier to remember all the coordinating conjunctions with the acronym **FANBOYS** (**F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, and **S**o).

**Connectors** are linking words used to connect words or phrases. There are many different connectors in English, and we can classify them into different categories: addition, cause/effect, comparison, conclusion, contrast, emphasis, illustration, time/ sequence, etc.
We separate the categories according to their use:

| CATEGORY          | USE                                                          | EXAMPLE                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ADDITION          | Adds one phrase to another, gives extra information, or introduces additional ideas. | I have coffee and pancakes for breakfast. Additionally, I eat fruits. |
| CAUSE AND EFFECT  | Explains the reason for something and the consequence of an action. | I don’t like to study very much. For this reason, I always fail my exams. |
| COMPARISON        | Compares ideas.                                              | I think hotdogs are good. Likewise, I think hamburgers are good. |

| CONTRAST          | Links two contrasting ideas.                                 | I love watching movies. However, I don’t like watching TV shows. |
| EMPHASIS          | Emphasizes ideas.                                            | I love watching movies, especially dramas.                   |
| ILLUSTRATION      | Exemplifies something.                                       | I can play different musical instruments, for example, the guitar, the piano, and the bass. |
| TIME AND SEQUENCE | Links actions that happened at the same time and indicates the order of the events. | First, brush your teeth. Then, go to bed.                    |





## Parallel structure

We should use a parallel structure to make your writing more effective. Be sure that all the items are in the same grammatical form when writing a series of words or phrases in a sentence. You may use a parallel structure in different situations:

**Verbs:** the form of the verb needs to be the same.

- **WRONG:** I like **eating** pizza, **listening** to music, and **to play** soccer.
- **CORRECT:** I like **eating** pizza, **listening** to music, and **playing** soccer.

**Verb + noun:** some nouns ask for specific verbs.

- **WRONG:** They **read books** and **music.**
- **CORRECT:** They **read books** and **listen to music.**

**Noun number:** agree singular, plural, countable, and uncountable.

- **WRONG:** They sell **pineapples**, **oranges**, and **an apple** in the supermarket.
- **CORRECT:** They sell **pineapples**, **oranges**, and **apples** in the supermarket.

**Subject matter:** everything discussed in the sentence should be related, so the connection is clear to the reader.

- **WRONG:** I **finished my project**, and I **ate cake**.
- **CORRECT:** I **finished my project**, and I **ate cake to celebrate.**

**Punctuation:** when writing lists or series.

- **WRONG:** My cousin traveled to Bogotá, Colombia, New York, USA; and Barcelona, Spain
- **CORRECT:** My cousin traveled to Bogotá, Colombia; New York, USA; and Barcelona, Spain.

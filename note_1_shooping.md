**Differences between Online and Traditional shopping**

**Physical Shopping**

- Can visit the place 🏬
- Can touch the products ✋
- Can see the products 👀
- Maybe have an assistant 👨
- Several payment ways 💳 💸
- A cashier 👩‍🏭
  **E-commerce**
- Accessible from any device 📱 💻 🖥️
- No immediate delivery 📫
  **Similarities between both**
- Shopping cart 🛒
- Sales / Discounts
  **Where do you prefer to shop?**
  I prefer to shop in a physical store, because:
  1.- You get the product Immediate
  2.- I haven’t a credit/debit card yet 😞
  **Where can you find the best discounts?**
  I think online, there are a lot of events and discounts on holidays and other important days, like:
  Christmas, black Friday, San Valentin, etc. 📅

# What is a pronoun?

It is a word that stand in for a noun.

- **without pronoun** -  Samantha gave Samanta's dog the dog's bath.
- **with pronoun**  - Samantha gave **her** dog **its** bath.
- **without pronoun** - Please say the name of the person on the other end of this telephone.
- **with pronoun** - **Who** are **you**? **What** is **your** name?

## Here are the ways we use pronouns:

- **to name specific people or things**: - `You` look like `him`.
- **to point to non-specific people or things**: - `Everyone` enjoyed the party, but `nobody` remembered to thank the hostess.
- **to point something:**  `This` is the dress I want.
- **to refer back to the subject:** Bruce hurt `himself`.
- **to show mutual action:** Ryan and Wesley were wrestling and hurt `each` `other`. 
- **To add emphasis:**  I `myself` love pronouns.
- **to ask a question:** **`Who`** is that?
- **to show ownership:** That's not yours; it's mine!

## Whatching out for crazy antecedets

**Note**: The pronoun almost always refers to the noun closets to it. If you put pronouns in odd places, it's hard to tell what the antecedent is. Sometimes sentences can get pretty crazy.

> **Crazy:** It was pitch dark an my cat was still outdoors. I grabbed my flashlight to begin the search and `listened for its purr.`

In the crazy example, the  `listened for its purr` seems to refer to a flashlight.

> **Better:** It was pitch dark and my cat was still outdoors. I grabbed my flashlight to begin the search and listened for Magic's purr. (Magic is the name of her cat)

## When is Josh a "him" and when is he a "he"?

### Which is correct?

- I like you better than him.
- I like you better than he. 

Both are correct, but they mean entirely  different things.

- I like you better than him = I like you better than I like him.
- I like you better than he = I like you better than he likes you. 

### Pronouns come in three groups called cases.

1. Subjective case - the doer (subject) of the action: `I` throw the ball
2. Objective case - The receiver (object) of the action: Thow the ball to `me`. 
3. Possessive case - Shows ownership: `My` throw to third base won the game!

| Subjective case | Objective case         | Possessive case |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| I sing          | Sing to me             | my song         |
| You sing        | Joe sings to you       | your song       |
| She signs       | Sing to her            | her song        |
| He signs        | Sing to him            | his song        |
| It signs        | Sing to it             | its song        |
| We sing         | Sing to us             | our song        |
| They sing       | Sing to them           | their song      |
| Who sings?      | To whom does Joe sing? | whose song      |

### What is wrong with these sentences?

How can your tell whether to use a subjective pronoum or an objective pronoum? Add more words to the sentence (or delete words) until you can tell which pronoun sounds right.

- Mom cooked dinner for Brian and **`I`**. - incorrect  - add word (for)
  - Mom cooked dinner for Brian and (for) I. - Sounds wrong
  - Mom cooked dinner for Brian and (for) me - Sounds better
  - Mon cooked dinner for brian and me. - Right form.
- **Us** eighth graders are studying algebra. - incorrect - delete words (eighth graders)
  - Us are studying algebra. -- Sounds wrong.
  - We are studying algebra. -- Sounds better.
  - We eighth graders are studying algebra. - Right form

**Here is another trick to use when you are confused:** turn the sentence around  and notice what sounds right.

- In language arts, the best students are Ryan and (me / I )
  -  Me and the best student. - Sounds wrong.
  - I am the best student. - Much better.
  - In language arts, the best students are Ryan and I. - Correct

## Polite pronouns

**It is considered polite to put yourself second.**

- Wrong: Me and Mike want to go to town.
- Right but not so polite: I and Mike want to go to town.
- Polite: Mike and I want to go to town.

**Is 'It me' or 'It I'**

In informal speech or writing, it's okay use `"It's me"`, but in formal writing or public speaking , use `"It's I"`

## The obliquitous you

Ubiquitous means " It's everywhere!" You is  one of the most overused words in our language. In formal writing, be careful. When using the word you, the witer should really mean "You , the reader" , not someone, anyone or everyone.

> **Informal**: If you add one and one, you get two.
>
> **Formal**: One plus one equals two.

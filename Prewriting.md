# **Writing process:**

____________



- **What do you want to communicate?**
- **Why is it important?**
- **Who is your audience?**


I think (for me) the most difficult step of writing is prewriting because IÂ´m not very creative

The writing process starts when you decide what you want to communicate, why it is relevant, and who is the audience of your writing. There are five simples steps you can follow that will help your writing process to be more effective:

1. **Prewriting:** explore possible topics, choose one, and collect ideas.
2. **Drafting:** put all your ideas down on paper.
3. **Revising:** read your draft and improve its form and content. You can add, remove, and change words. You can also rearrange the sentences.
4. **Editing / Proof writing:** fix all the errors in grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.
5. **Publishing:** present your writing to an audience

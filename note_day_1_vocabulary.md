### Lecture: Reading Wisely

The youngster who reads `voraciously`, though `indiscriminately`, does not necessarily gain in wisdom over the teenager who is more selective in his reading choices. A young man who has read the life story of every `eminent` athlete of the twentieth century, or a `coed` who has `steeped` herself in every social- protest novel she can get her hands on, may very well be learning all there is to know in a very limited area. But books are `replete` with so many wonders that it is often discouraging to see bright young people limit their own experiences.

1. The football game was `replete` with excitement and great plays. 
2. The `eminent` author received the Nobel Prize for literature.
3. My cousin is so `steeped` in schoolwork that his friends call him a `bookworm`.
4. After skiing, I find that I have a `voracious` appetite.
5. Modern `warfare` often results in the `indiscriminate` killing of combatants and innocent civilians `alike`.

## Capitalization, Abbreviations, and Indentation

Capitalization is to write the first letter of a word with a capital letter (uppercase) and the remaining letters in lowercase.

English capitalization basic rules:

- ***\*The pronoun “I”:\**** My sister and **I** watch TV.
- **The first letter of a sentence:** **M**y name is Fernanda.
- ***\*Names and Titles:\**** This is ***\*M\****r. ***\*J\****ones.
- ***\*Cities and Countries:\**** I live in ***\*B\****ogotá, ***\*C\****olombia.
- ***\*Nationalities and Languages:\**** I am ***\*B\****razilian, and I speak ***\*P\****ortuguese.
- ***\*Days / Months / Holidays:\**** Today is ***\*S\****unday, ***\*F\****ebruary 14th. It’s ***\*V\****alentine’s ***\*D\****ay!

Abbreviations are any shortened form of a word. Two common types of abbreviations are acronyms and initialisms.

An acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You **can** pronounce it as a word.

- ***\*NASA\**** (***\*N\****ational ***\*A\****eronautics and ***\*S\****pace ***\*A\****dministration)
- ***\*PIN\**** (***\*P\****ersonal **I**dentification ***\*N\****umber)
- ***\*LASER\**** (***\*L\****ight ***\*A\****mplification by ***\*S\****timulated ***\*E\****mission of ***\*R\****adiation)

An initialism is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You ***\*cannot\**** pronounce it as a word.

- ***\*DIY\**** (***\*D\****o ***\*I\****t ***\*Y\****ourself)
- ***\*USA\**** (***\*U\****nited ***\*S\****tates of ***\*A\****merica)
- ***\*DVD\**** (***\*D\****igital ***\*V\****ersatile ***\*D\****isk)

You can form other abbreviations by removing a few letters of a single word.

- ***\*Titles: Mr.\**** Jones (Mister) / ***\*Dr.\**** Gonzalez (Doctor)
- ***\*Times / Dates:\**** 10 ***\*am\**** (ante meridiem) / ****Jan.** **(January) / ***\*Mon.\**** (Monday)
- **Places:** 5th **Ave.***(Avenue) / Main **St**(Street)
- **Units of measurement:** 20 **g**(grams) / 80 ***\*oz\**** (ounces)

**Be careful!**

These abbreviations are only for writing. Say the complete word when speaking. Also, the punctuation may vary when using American English and British English:

***\*American English:\**** abbreviations always finish with a period (Mr. / Dr. / Mon. / etc.).

**British English:** abbreviations only finish with a period when they do not end with the same letter of the original word (Mr / Dr / Mon. / etc.).

When writing a paragraph, it is necessary to pay attention to its format. There are two formats you can use:

- ***\*First-line Indent:\**** start your writing further away from the edge of the paper. It creates a faster and also linear experience for the reader. It is common in fiction, narrative, biography, and scholarly publications.
- ***\*Block:\**** start your writing at the edge of the paper and use a margin of white space between paragraphs. In this way, the reader understands there is a new paragraph. It creates an idea of specific information in each paragraph. It is common in business guides and technical manuals.

#### Listen to the conversation between an apartment house manager and a man who wants to rent an apartment.

W1: Good morning. **How may I help you?** - `hau meiai helpiu`
M1: Yes, I was wondering, do you have any one-bedroom apartments **available**? - `aveilabol`
W1: Yes we do. Were you looking for yourself?
M1: Yes, it’s for me.
W1: Let me just get some information from you then, for **our application** form. May I have your name?
M1: Yes. It’s Kingston. James Kingston.
W1: And what’s your current address?
M1: I live over on State Street. Number 1705 State Street, apartment seven.
W1: And your phone number?
M1: My home phone? It’s 721-0584.
W1: Work phone?
M1: 721-1127.
W1: Great. I need to know just one more thing. What is your date of **birth**? - `berft`
M1: December 12, **1978**.
W1: Thank you. Now, you’re interested in a one-bedroom apartment, correct?
M1: That’s right.
W1: Did you want just a one-bedroom, or a one-bedroom with a **den**? We have several of those available, and a study is really nice. Having that extra room gives you space for a small home office or you can use it as a guest room.

M1: I don’t think so. I live alone. I don’t need an extra room.

W1: Right. Then I’ll put you down for a simple one bedroom. With a balcony?
M1: No, I don’t need that. I’ll tell you what I do need, though, is a parking space.
W1: We have **garage** parking spaces available for a low **monthly fee.** - `gaarazh` - `Montly fii`
M1: Great. I **really** need that. Oh, and, um, something else. I need an apartment with lots of closets for storage.
W1: We actually have storage areas in the **basement.** You can rent your own storage space by the **month.**
M1: Hmmm. That sounds like a good idea.
W1: All right. So I’ll put you down for a storage space in the basement.
M1: Sounds good.
W1: Are you **interested** in **our** **exercise** **club**? We have an exercise room with several pieces of equipment as well as a sauna. - `intrested` - `our ecersais clod`
M1: Is it **included** in the rent? -`inclooded`
W1: It’s available for a small extra fee.
M1: Then I don’t think so. I can always go for a walk for free.
W1: All right then, one bedroom, no balcony. . . . I have several apartments you might like. One of them has a fireplace. Would you be interested in that?
M1: Do I have to pay extra for it?
W1: **Actually** no. That apartment is **slightly** **smaller** than our other one bedrooms, so **even** **though** it has a fireplace, the rent isn’t any higher.- `acsuli` - `slaili` -`smoler` -`iven` -`dough`
M1: OK then I’ll take the fireplace.
W1: There is one **drawback** to that apartment. It doesn’t have a washing machine. You’ll have to go out to a **laundromat**. 
M1: Oh. Well, I suppose that doesn’t matter. Can I see the apartment today?
W1: **Certainly**. I can show it to you now. However, we’re still **painting it**, so it won’t be **available** until next month.- `serdanli` -`peintin it` 
M1: I was hoping to move next week, but . . . . maybe I can wait.
W1: And I’ll need a small **deposit** to hold it for you, just 50 percent of the first month’s rent.
